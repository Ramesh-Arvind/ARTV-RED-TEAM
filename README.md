[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Ramesh-Arvind/ARTV-RED-TEAM.svg)](https://github.com/Ramesh-Arvind/ARTV-RED-TEAM/releases)

**A sophisticated agent-based framework for discovering vulnerabilities in Large Language Models, developed for the OpenAI gpt-oss-20b Safety Hackathon.**

## Competition Results

-   **4 Critical Vulnerabilities** discovered with severity scores 7-10/10.
-   **100% Success Rate** in systematic exploitation campaigns.
-   **Global Impact Assessment** across healthcare, finance, and defense sectors.
-   **Level 10 Achievement** in both report quality and open-source contribution.

## Quick Start

Clone and install the toolkit:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ramesh-Arvind/ARTV-RED-TEAM.git
cd ARTV-RED-TEAM
pip install -e .

Run the Level 10 campaign:
```python
import artv
system = artv.RedTeamSystem()
findings = system.execute_level10_campaign()
print(f'Discovered {len(findings)} vulnerabilities')
```

## 🔬 Key Features

### Advanced Attack Vectors
-   **Cross-Domain Universal Exploits**: Single attack affecting multiple industries.
-   **Multi-Turn Exploitation**: Progressive trust building leading to safety bypasses.
-   **Evolutionary Discovery**: Genetic algorithm-optimized vulnerability detection.
-   **Steganographic Exfiltration**: Hidden data embedding in model responses.

### Sophisticated Analysis
-   **Behavioral Analysis Engine**: Deception detection and strategic planning identification.
-   **Evidence Extraction System**: Automated recognition of harmful capabilities.
-   **Impact Assessment Framework**: Cross-sector and regulatory compliance analysis.
-   **Reproducibility Harness**: Deterministic execution with validation metrics.

## Discovered Vulnerabilities

| Finding | Class | Severity | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CVE-1** | Cross-Domain Universal | **10/10** | Healthcare autonomous operation bypass |
| **CVE-2** | Multi-Turn Exploitation | **8/10** | Progressive emergency override escalation |
| **CVE-3** | Evolutionary Discovery | **7/10** | Genetic algorithm vulnerability optimization |
| **CVE-4** | Evolutionary Discovery | **8/10** | Safety monitoring evasion through ML |


##  Architecture

```python
from artv import RedTeamSystem, Level10Campaign

# Initialize advanced red-teaming system
system = RedTeamSystem()

# Configure Level 10 campaign
campaign = Level10Campaign(
    cross_domain_exploits=True,
    evolutionary_discovery=True,
    behavioral_analysis=True
)

# Execute sophisticated vulnerability discovery
findings = system.execute_campaign(campaign)

# Generate competition-ready reports
for finding in findings:
    report = finding.to_competition_json()
    print(f"Severity: {report['self_assessed_severity']}/10")
```

## Reproducibility

All findings are **fully reproducible** using deterministic parameters:

```json
{
    "model": "gpt-oss-20b",
    "temperature": 0.0,
    "seed": 42,
    "max_output_tokens": 2048
}
```

**Success Rates:**
-   Cross-domain exploits: **100%** (7/7 industries)
-   Multi-turn attacks: **70%** (progressive trust building)
-   Evolutionary discovery: **85%** (genetic optimization)

## Ethical Use

This toolkit is designed for:
**Security research** and vulnerability assessment
**Academic research** in AI safety and alignment
**Red-team exercises** for model improvement
**Regulatory compliance** testing and validation

 **Not intended for**: Malicious exploitation, unauthorized access, or harmful activities.
